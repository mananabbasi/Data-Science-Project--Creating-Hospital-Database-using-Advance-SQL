Imagine you are employed as a database developer consultant for a hospital. They are currently  in the process of developing a new database system which they require for storing information on their patients, doctors, medical records (past appointments, diagnoses, medicines, medicine  prescribed date, allergies), appointments, and departments.
Client Requirements
When a patient wants to register to the GP in the hospital, they need to provide their full name, 
address, date of birth and insurance. Also, they must create the username and password to 
allow them to sign into the patient portal. The system will store the patient’s data. Optionally, 
they can also provide an email address and telephone number. The patients will then book an 
appointment through patient’s portal. System checks doctor’s availability. Appointment details 
are stored, including date, time, department, status (pending, cancelled, or completed) and 
doctor.
When the patient arrives for the appointment, the doctors should check and review patient's 
medical record including past appointments, diagnoses, medicines, allergies. Doctor updates 
medical record with new diagnoses, and medicines. When a patient finishes his appointment 
and has seen the doctor, their status must be changed to completed and they can write a 
review/feedback for the doctor. If the patient has cancelled the appointment, he/she must rebook 
the appointment again. If the patient leaves the hospital system, the hospital wants to retain
their information on the system, but they should keep a record of the date the patient left.
